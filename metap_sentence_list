NTI__BWTutorial_chapter1.xml
the release of nerve gas on the tokyo subway by a japanese cult on march 20, 1995 , the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( cbw ) to inflict mass casualties .


NTI__BWTutorial_chapter1.xml
this tutorial addresses several aspects of biological warfare ( bw ) terrorism , with the goal of providing a greater understanding of the threat and the available policy responses .


NTI__BWTutorial_chapter1.xml
for example , walter laqueur , a terrorism specialist at the center for strategic and international studies in washington, d.c. , defines terrorism as : `` the sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''


NTI__BWTutorial_chapter1.xml
for the purposes of this tutorial , however , the term `` terrorism '' will be used to describe acts that incorporate the following elements : intentional or threatened violence directed against civilians or noncombatants ; actors that are sub - national groups or individuals ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .


NTI__BWTutorial_chapter1.xml
if used effectively , cbw are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .


NTI__BWTutorial_chapter1.xml
terrorists may seek to obtain greater status or bargaining power by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver cbw agents .


NTI__BWTutorial_chapter1.xml
terrorists may seek to obtain greater status or bargaining power by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver cbw agents .


NTI__BWTutorial_chapter1.xml
those groups and individuals most likely to engage in terrorism with chemical or biological weapons lie at the intersection of three attributes : ( 1 ) motivation , ( 2 ) organizational structure , and ( 3 ) technical capability .


NTI__BWTutorial_chapter1.xml
a few terrorist groups active today are more motivated to carry out mass - casualty attacks , better organized to resist outside penetration , and are actively pursuing technologies and know-how relevant to cbw terrorism .


NTI__BWTutorial_chapter1.xml
a few terrorist groups active today are more motivated to carry out mass - casualty attacks , better organized to resist outside penetration , and are actively pursuing technologies and know-how relevant to cbw terrorism .


NTI__BWTutorial_chapter1.xml
over the past few decades , however , a `` new breed '' of terrorists has come on the scene .


NTI__BWTutorial_chapter1.xml
whereas most terrorist groups during the 1960s and 1970s were motivated either by left-wing ideology ( socialist / communist policies advocated by marxist - leninist or maoist groups ) or by national - separatist goals ( a group 's pursuit to become an independent state based on its ethnic , racial , or cultural make-up ) , the number of groups characterized primarily by religious beliefs began to increase in the 1980s .


NTI__ChinaOverview.xml
the series of nuclear tests in 1995 - 96 prior to china 's signature of the comprehensive test ban treaty ( ctbt ) may have resulted in a smaller and lighter warhead design for the new generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles ( icbms ) now under development .


NTI__ChinaOverview.xml
while china has publicly declared to be consistently in compliance with the btwc , past u.s. government reports have alleged that china not only has a small - scale offensive biological weapons program , but has also transferred controlled biological weapons - related items to nations of proliferation concern such as iran .


NTI__ChinaOverview.xml
china has produced and deployed a wide range of ballistic missiles , ranging from short - range missiles to intercontinental ballistic missiles ( icbms ) .


NTI__Iran_Biological.xml
currently , its growing biotechnology industry does have the potential to divert dual - use agents for illicit warfare purposes .


NTI__Iran_Biological.xml
all of these research areas have legitimate and important uses for improving crop yields and reducing the threat to iran 's agricultural industry posed by pests and disease .


NTI__Iran_Chemical.xml
this difficulty is compounded by the fact that much of the information can be directly traced back to just a handful of sources , none of which can be independently verified .


NTI__Iran_Chemical.xml
the following profile attempts to piece together an objective overview of allegations surrounding iran and its cw capabilities by mining through reports in open source literature from a variety of sources .


NTI__Iran_Chemical.xml
the weak international response , particularly by the united nations , to iraqi use of chemical weapons against iranian forces left iran bitter about what it perceived to be a double standard in enforcing international agreements .


NTI__Iran_Chemical.xml
while several iranian leaders felt that developing a cw program would counteract the iraqi threat and prove to be a strong deterrent , others within the clerical islamic regime publicly condemned any use of chemicals on moral grounds , calling them un - islamic .


NTI__Iran_Chemical.xml
the cia believes that `` teheran is rapidly approaching self-sufficiency and could become a supplier of cw - related materials to other nations . ''


NTI__Iran_Chemical.xml
iran continues to deny any allegations that it is actively pursuing an offensive cw program .


NTI__Iran_Chemical.xml
in an unclassified report to congress , the dci said that `` chinese firms had supplied cw - related production equipment and technology to iran , '' prior to july 1999 , and that evidence during the second half of 1999 `` suggests iran continues to seek such assistance from chinese entities , but it is unclear to what extent these efforts have succeeded . ''


NTI__Iran_Introduction.xml
iran 's chemical weapons and ballistic missiles , and possibly its nuclear weapon program and biological warfare capabilities , are meant to deter opponents and to gain influence in the persian gulf and caspian sea regions .


NTI__Iran_Introduction.xml
in the mid - 1970s , iran initiated a nuclear power program , though there are reports that it also began a small nuclear weapon research program at the same time .


NTI__Iran_Introduction.xml
the united states believes that nuclear energy is not necessary in a country with iran 's large oil supply .


NTI__Iran_Introduction.xml
during the iaea 's visit to iran , iranian officials indicated that iran would honor its safeguards agreement with the iaea , but did not clearly indicate iran 's willingness to accept the additional protocol .


NTI__Iran_Introduction.xml
this means that iran will place the natanz facility , and any enriched uranium it produces , under iaea inspection but that , as long as no nuclear materials are present , the iaea would have no ability to examine locations in iran where it believed nuclear weapons design research might be under way .


NTI__Iran_Introduction.xml
the united states alleges that iran may have started to develop small quantities of agent , possibly including mycotoxins , ricin , and the smallpox virus .


NTI__Iran_Introduction.xml
iran possesses one of the largest missile inventories in the middle east and has acquired complete missile systems and developed an infrastructure to build missiles indigenously .


NTI__Iran_Missile.xml
a large number of iran 's ballistic missiles and / or long - range artillery rocket systems currently possess the capability to deliver conventional high explosive , submunition , chemical , biological and radiological dispersion warheads .

during february 1979 , the imperial iranian regime of the shah mohammed reza pahlavi collapsed , and along with it died project flower .


NTI__Iran_Missile.xml
it was during this period that iran also approached both the dprk and people's republic of china ( prc ) seeking missile technology and tactical ballistic missiles in the scud-b class .


NTI__Iran_Missile.xml
upon arrival , the missiles were assigned to a newly created battalion - sized missile unit of the islamic revolution guard corps ( irgc ) air force , whose personnel had received preliminary training in both libya and syria .


NTI__Iran_Missile.xml
in both countries , hashemi - rafsanjani secured increased military assistance and agreements to sell iranian missiles and engage in bilateral missile technology exchanges .


NTI__Iran_Missile.xml
specifically , during the visit to the prc , he secured a prc agreement in the following missile - related areas : the delivery of hy-1 silkworm and hy-2 seersucker coastal defense missiles beginning in 1986 and assistance in establishing an assembly facility for these missiles .


NTI__Iran_Missile.xml
the visit to the dprk was equally fruitful , and he secured dprk assistance in the following missile - related areas : the delivery of hn-5a sams and assistance in establishing an assembly facility for these and the hq-1/2 sams .

these personnel have the potential to bring back a tremendous wealth of technical expertise and experience .


NTI__Iran_Missile.xml
the united states has cited numerous cases of iran receiving assistance in its missile production from countries such as north korea and russia , and has even placed sanctions on private companies for aiding iran .

iran believes that a strong missile force is critical to its security and acts as a deterrent to foreign ( especially us ) aggression .


NTI__Iran_Missile.xml
primary among these are : the continued willingness of the democratic people's republic of korea ( dprk ) , the people's republic of china ( prc ) , and russia to provide iran with both missiles and missile - related technology that at the very least exceed the intentions of the missile technology control regime ( mtcr ) .

in 1966 , for reasons that are unclear , the dprk later turned to the soviets for assistance in cw , mostly in the form of training manuals and small quantities of nerve and mustard agents .


NTI__NorthKorea_ChemicalOverview.xml
finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that north korea was able to produce cw agents in large quantity , and deployed large numbers of chemical ordnance .


NTI__NorthKorea_ChemicalOverview.xml
finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that north korea was able to produce cw agents in large quantity , and deployed large numbers of chemical ordnance .


NTI__NorthKorea_ChemicalOverview.xml
recent estimates of north korean chemical ordnance by the south korean ministry of national defense ( mnd ) have since been raised to the thousands of tons , probably based on recent information provided by north korean defectors , including former members of dprk military and nbc defence organizations .


NTI__NorthKorea_ChemicalOverview.xml
due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for cw agents , it is believed that north korea emphasizes production of phosgene , mustard , sarin , and v - agents. ( previous reports have also alleged a large stock of sarin nerve agent. ) in 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 facilities in the dprk where raw chemicals , precursors , and cw agents are produced and / or stored .


NTI__NorthKorea_ChemicalOverview.xml
reflecting soviet military doctrine , the dprk has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an integral part of any military offensive .


NTI__NorthKorea_ChemicalOverview.xml
north korea 's chemical defense force is estimated to be around 13,000 personnel , probably making it the third - largest cw service in the world , with chemical defense units incorporated at the regimental level .


NTI__NorthKorea_ChemicalOverview.xml
although the majority of the cw stockpile in the north may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal nerve agent variety , it may contain a large quantity of casualty agents such as mustard , phosgene , and lewisite , all compounds that are relatively easy to manufacture .


NTI__NorthKorea_ChemicalOverview.xml
if north korea wishes to foster a viable chemical industry , a case could be made that its accession to the cwc would make long - term economic sense by giving it access to trade in treaty - controlled chemicals and technology .


NTI__NorthKorea_Introduction.xml
north korea has reportedly established a facility to produce uf6 at the yongbyon nuclear complex , which gives pyongyang the capability to produce the stock of uranium hexafluoride ( uf6 ) gas to feed the cascades of centrifuges in a large-scale plant . 


NTI__NorthKorea_Introduction.xml
during 19-21 april 2004 , north korean national defense commission chairman kim jong il visited china and reportedly told chinese president hu jintao that `` the drpk side will continue to adopt a patient and flexible manner and actively participate in the six - party talks process , and make its own contributions to the progress of the talks .

many analysts now believe the talks are dead , and in early may 2005 there were reports that washington and tokyo were preparing to refer the issue to the un security council .


NTI__NorthKorea_NuclearOverview.xml
in the early 1960s , the soviet union provided extensive technical assistance while north korea constructed its yo ( ngbyo ( n nuclear research center , which included the installation of a soviet irt- 2000 nuclear research reactor , and other facilities ( see yo ( ngbyo ( n nuclear research center ) .


NTI__NorthKorea_NuclearOverview.xml
the cabinet and the academy of sciences were given operational and administrative oversight of the nuclear facilities , but ultimate control of the program and decisions over weapons development belonged to north korean leader kim il sung .


NTI__NorthKorea_NuclearOverview.xml
in the late 1960s , north korea continued to expand its educational and research institutions to support a nuclear program for both civilian and military applications .


NTI__NorthKorea_NuclearOverview.xml
by the early 1970s , north korean engineers were using indigenous technology to expand the irt- 2000 research reactor and pyongyang began to acquire plutonium reprocessing technology from the soviet union .

during the cold war , and afterwards , the soviet union had the world 's largest arsenal of chemical weapons , including artillery shells , bombs , and missiles that contained choking agents ( phosgene ) , nerve agents ( sarin , soman , and vx ) , and blister agents ( mustard , lewisite , and mustard - lewisite mixture ) .


NTI__SouthAfrica_Introduction.xml
south africa is the first and , to date , only country to build a nuclear arsenal , and then voluntarily dismantle its entire nuclear weapons program .

and the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular , as well as to violate some cherished vested interests .


PropBank__PolemicProgressiveEducation.xml
these beliefs so dominate our educational establishment , our media , our politicians , and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them .


PropBank__PolemicProgressiveEducation.xml
fortunately , these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and they have enough common sense to know what that demands .

there is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures ( in real terms ) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has declined .

tuesday 's rout of a gop congressional hopeful in a mississippi district that has n't backed a democratic presidential candidate since adlai stevenson is another reminder that , at least at the federal level , political `` ticket splitting '' has been on the rise over the past half century .

first , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : prior to the election of franklin roosevelt as president and the advent of the new deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for congress was considerably less severe .

to the extent that democratic legislators from the south have held a disproportionate share of power in congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the south have had an especially strong incentive to keep such democrats in office .

an additional piece of evidence from the senate : holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state ( a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder ) .
